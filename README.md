# 🐢 Taminal 

This was created during my time with Code Chrysalis.

To Begin, git clone the repository to your computer and run the following command below.

```
cargo run
```

It should load up the Taminal immediately from the command line. If not you can run...

```
rustc .\src\main.rs
```

This command will create a "main.exe" in which you can double click to load up the terminal.
